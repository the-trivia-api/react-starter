# Trivia API React Starter

This project shows how to use [The Trivia API](https://the-trivia-api.com) to build a React quiz app. Do whatever you like with it - fork the repo, copy code snippets, lift the whole thing if you want.

To get going, run `npm install` followed by `npm start`. This will run the app locally at http://localhost:3000.
